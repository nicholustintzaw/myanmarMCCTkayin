abstract = {When patients receive an intervention based on whether they score below or above some threshold value on a continuously measured random variable, the intervention will be randomly assigned for patients close to the threshold. The regression discontinuity design exploits this fact to estimate causal treatment effects. In spite of its recent proliferation in economics, the regression discontinuity design has not been widely adopted in epidemiology. We describe regression discontinuity, its implementation, and the assumptions required for causal inference. We show that regression discontinuity is generalizable to the survival and nonlinear models that are mainstays of epidemiologic analysis. We then present an application of regression discontinuity to the much-debated epidemiologic question of when to start HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy. Using data from a large South African cohort (2007-2011), we estimate the causal effect of early versus deferred treatment eligibility on mortality. Patients whose first CD4 count was just below the 200 cells/$\mu$L CD4 count threshold had a 35{\%} lower hazard of death (hazard ratio = 0.65 [95{\%} confidence interval = 0.45-0.94]) than patients presenting with CD4 counts just above the threshold. We close by discussing the strengths and limitations of regression discontinuity designs for epidemiology. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by Lippincott Williams  {\&}  Wilkins.},

@book{WorldHealthOrganizationWHO2006,
abstract = {The origin of the WHO Child Growth Standards dates back to the early 1990s and a meticulous evaluation of the NCHS growth reference, which had been recommended for international use since the late 1970s. The review documented the deficiencies of the reference and led to a plan for developing new growth charts that would depict how children should grow in all countries rather than merely describing how they grew at a particular time and place. The outcome of this plan was the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (1997-2003), which applied rigorous methods of data collection and serves as a model of collaboration for conducting international research. The study provides a solid foundation for developing a standard because the sample is based on healthy children living under conditions likely to favor achievement of their full genetic growth potential. Furthermore, the mothers of the children selected for the construction of the standards engaged in fundamental health-promoting practices, namely breastfeeding and not smoking. Other important features of the study are that it included children from a diverse set of countries (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and USA) and explicitly identified breastfeeding as the biological norm and established the breastfed child as the normative model for growth and development. By replacing the NCHS reference, which is based on children from a single country, with one based on an international group of children, the new standards recognize that children the world over grow similarly when their health and care needs are met. The WHO Child Growth Standards provide a technically robust tool for assessing the well-being of infants and young children. The standards depict normal growth under optimal environmental conditions and can be used to assess children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding.},

@article{Bhutta2013,
abstract = {Summary Maternal undernutrition contributes to 800 000 neonatal deaths annually through small for gestational age births; stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies are estimated to underlie nearly 3{\textperiodcentered}1 million child deaths annually. Progress has been made with many interventions implemented at scale and the evidence for effectiveness of nutrition interventions and delivery strategies has grown since The Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition in 2008. We did a comprehensive update of interventions to address undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in women and children and used standard methods to assess emerging new evidence for delivery platforms. We modelled the effect on lives saved and cost of these interventions in the 34 countries that have 90{\%} of the world's children with stunted growth. We also examined the effect of various delivery platforms and delivery options using community health workers to engage poor populations and promote behaviour change, access and uptake of interventions. Our analysis suggests the current total of deaths in children younger than 5 years can be reduced by 15{\%} if populations can access ten evidence-based nutrition interventions at 90{\%} coverage. Additionally, access to and uptake of iodised salt can alleviate iodine deficiency and improve health outcomes. Accelerated gains are possible and about a fifth of the existing burden of stunting can be averted using these approaches, if access is improved in this way. The estimated total additional annual cost involved for scaling up access to these ten direct nutrition interventions in the 34 focus countries is Int{\$}9{\textperiodcentered}6 billion per year. Continued investments in nutrition-specific interventions to avert maternal and child undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies through community engagement and delivery strategies that can reach poor segments of the population at greatest risk can make a great difference. If this improved access is linked to nutrition-sensitive approaches—ie, women's empowerment, agriculture, food systems, education, employment, social protection, and safety nets—they can greatly accelerate progress in countries with the highest burden of maternal and child undernutrition and mortality.},
